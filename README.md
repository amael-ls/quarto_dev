# README
This repo is dedicated to lua filters for Quarto. Some filters are taken or inspired from other GitHub users. Each subfolder is for one filter, with the origin specified when not from me. To create a filter, the best is to check the doc [creating filters](https://quarto.org/docs/extensions/filters.html).
Before creating anything, check the [quarto extensions](https://quarto.org/docs/extensions/), maybe someone did the job already!
