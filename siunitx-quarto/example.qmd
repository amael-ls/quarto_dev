This filter is able to handle some command from the siunitx package, such as:

1. num (with random spaces) \num{ 123 45678 9   }
2. The qty command without power or per, such as \qty{3}{\micro\meter}, \qty{28}{\degreeCelsius}. My resistance to \qty{72}{\percent} dark chocolate is \qty{23}{\nano\ohm}
